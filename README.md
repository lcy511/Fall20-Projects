# Fall20-Projects: Gobblet AI with Minimax
This game AI implements Minimax algorithm and Alpha-Beta pruning to play the gobblet game.


## My Variation
Players can move an off-board piece of any size. They donâ€™t need to follow the rule that players are only allowed to move the piece from the top of the off-board stack.
